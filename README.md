## 1. Introduction

This section will provide an overview about the application, the problem statement, the aims and
objectives and the scope.

## 1.1 Introduction


“PlayNext” is a menu-based console application that i have chosen to design for my SIS 1040Y -
Software Design Fundamentals and Programming module. This document will give the reader an
overview of the application and how it works. This part provides a clear description of the problem
statement, aims and objectives and the scope.
```
## 1.2 Problem Statement

```
Deciding what video game to play next can be a daunting task, especially considering the huge list
of games available to play. I have been working to soothe those anxieties with a game
recommendation engine dubbed PlayNext, a game recommendation system that suggests new
games to try. It is a simple-to-use system that provides a fast answer to the question “what game to
play next?”
```
```
1.3 Aims and Objectives
The main aim of PlayNext is for the user to either select specific categories and subcategories of
games or search a game by name to obtain a list of reommended games. This list contains useful
information such as game title, Steam(An online game library) rating, link to the trailer video and
price of the game on “Steam”.
```
```
The objectives of the application are:
```
1. To easen the task of choosing a game to play.
2. To get relevant game recommendations based on a particular users’ preference.
3. To get accurate and useful information on the games recommended.

## 1.4 Scope

```
The application consist of a main categories menu where the user selects a main category he like.
The selected main category is then further broken down in different subcategories to get a more
accurate list of recommendation. The application also consist of a search option where the user can
search for a game by name. The program will then output a list of all the categories in which the
game belongs to.
```
```
The lists generated contain useful information about the different games so that the user can make
a good decision about which one to buy and play next.
```

## 2. Background Study.................................................................................

This section will provide an overview about the existing applications and the tools used to develop
the application.

## 2.1 Introduction

```
There are numerous similar applications online that are used to recommend games based on their
users’ preferences such as Quantic Lab and TasteDive. These are far more advanced
recommendation engines which uses machine learning and complex algorithms to produce a
recommendation list. PlayNext will be based off their core concepts only, which is to produce a list
based on user category selection and based on the name of the game searched. Below are some
screenshots of Quantic Lab and TasteDive.
```
```
Quantic Lab
Quantic Lab, available at https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/ , is a gamer survey project run by
long-time game researchers Nick Yee & Nic Ducheneaut. They combine social science and data
science to understand the psychology of gaming by taking the user’s profile to get a customized
report of their gaming motivations.
```
```

```
## Figure 2 : Quantic Lab - Game Recommendation List


**TasteDive**
TasteDive, available at **https://tastedive.com/games** , helps you discover new music, movies, TV
shows, books, authors, games, podcasts, and people with shared interests. As a visitor, you can get
instant suggestions using their recommendation engine.

## Figure 4 : TasteDive - Game Recommendation List


## 2.2 Potential Tools....................................................................................

**Code Editor:**
CodeBlocks is a free and easy to use C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding
needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable. It is an IDE with all
the features i will need and it also has a consistent look, feel and operation.

**Source Control Manager:**
Mercurial is a source control manager which is speedy, both in learning curve and execution speed.
But is has been reported that it is sometimes inconsistent and unpredictable. Its inflexibility is its
main flaw.

Git is another source control manager which is widely popular. Although it has a steeper learning
curve than mercurial, it has a huge support base across the internet which i can consult anytime to
look for information. Git is supported accross multiple platforms especially windows 10 which is
the OS i will use throughout this project.

**Source Control GUI:**
GitKraken is a modern source control gui. It has a beautiful interface and is simple and intuitive to
use. The most used features (such as pull, push, branch, stash, commit) are accessible in one click.
It is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows. However, it can have some issues when opening large
repositories and there have been cases where GitKraken started lagging once they were opened.

SourceTree is another beautiful, modern and clean source control gui. In addition to color-coded
branches and icons that tell if a file has been added, removed or modified, SourceTree also displays
the number of commits that are ahead and behind the remote branch. However some operations can
be slow especially on the windows version of SourceTree.

## 2.3 Summary of Findings

After a thorough research, it can be concluded that the above tools can be used to design and
implement the application.

I will use CodeBlocks as my code editor because it is required to use it in this project as per the
instructions. I have also decided to use Git as my source control manager as it is much more stable
and practical to use than mercurial. Finally i have chosen SourceTree as my source control GUI as
its simple and intuitive UI makes it easy and reliable to use.

```
Types of Tools Tools

## 3. Analysis...................................................................................................

```
This section will provide the analysis of the application, namely the proposed system, the functional
requirements, the non functional requirements, the use case diagrams as well as the tools chosen for
the development of the application.
```
```
3.1 Proposed System – Brief Description of System
The application features several menus. There is the main menu where the user can select several
options but most specifically where the user can choose to start the program. Upon starting, a
submenu is displayed which contains two options; Option 1 : Search By Category, Option 2 : Search
By Name. In option 1, a first list of main categories is displayed to the user. The user must choose a
category to proceed to the subcategories menu where the main category is further broken down in
subcategories. Once the user select his/her prefered subcategory, a list of games is displayed based
on the previous choices. In option 2, the user is asked to input the name of a game. The program
will output a list of games based on the category of the game entered by the user. This list contains
relevant and useful information about the different games the user is most likely to be interested in.
The different informations include, but is not limited to, the game title, the steam rating, a link to the
trailer video and the price on steam library. This list can then be exported in a text file for further
use.
```

## Figure 8 : Exit Screen


This figure shows the SubMenu which appears when the user start the program by selecting option
< 1 > in the main menu. This menu displays two options; Option 1: Search By Category and Option
2: Search By Name. The first option allows the user to generate a list of recommendation based on
selected game categories. The second option allows the user to enter the name of a game and a list
of similar games based on its category will be generated.

## Figure 9 : Sub menu


This figure shows the Main Categories menu which appears when the user select option < 1 > in the
sub menu. This menu displays a list of all main categories in alphabetical order. The user has the
option to select a main category in order to proceed to the Subcategories menu or the user has the
option to go back to the main menu.

This figure shows the Subcategories menu which appears once the user has selected a main category
in the Main Categories menu as shown above. This menu displays all the subcategories for the main
category the user has selected in the main categories menu. The user is asked to select a subcategory
in this menu in order to proceed.

## Figure 10 : Main Categories menu

## Figure 11 : Subcategories menu


This figure shows the list of games that are displayed according to the subcategory the user selected
in the Subcategories menu. The list displays all games with by default the following information:
Game Title, Steam Rating, Trailer Link & Price. The user has the option to export the list as a text
file at the bottom.

This figure shows the steps if the user choose to export the list as a text file. First the user has to
enter the path where the file is to be exported. Then the user must enter a name for the file to be
exported. Once these steps are completed, the export will also be completed and the file will be
generated at the specified path with the specified name.

## 4.2 Flowchart

This section contains the flowchart for the whole application.

## Figure 15 : Flowchart for whole application


## 5. Implementation

This section will provide the system requirements as well as the implementation of the modules.

## 5.1 System Requirements..........................................................................

```
The application requires a Personal Computer (PC) with a keyboard as hardware since it requires
the input from the latter to choose the different options. Since this is a console application
practically all Personal Computers with the command prompt software can run it. The minimum
storage to run the application properly must be approximately 2 MB of Hard drive space. The PC
shall have windows as its platform.
```
## 5.2 Implementation of each component

```
Main Menu
The main menu is controlled by the function MainMenu( ) which is found in the MainMenu.h
header file. The main menu contains four options; Option 1: Start Program , Option 2: Help ,
Option 3: Credits & Option 4 : Exit Program. The option 1 starts the application, option 2 displays
the help menu, option 3 displays the credits and option 3 exits the application.
```
```
Choices
All the different options in the main menu are controlled by the Choice(int choice) function found
in the Choice.h header file. This function takes one parameter. The variable choice stores the choice
the user has made and executes the correct function through a switch statement as shown below:
```
```
void Choice(int choice)
{
HANDLE hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE); // Initialise the
variable hConsole to set the color attribute.
```
```
// Determines which function to initialize based on the choice of the user
in the main menu
switch(choice)
{
case 1 :
SubMenu(); // Displays the Sub Menu
break;
case 2 :
Help(); // Displays the Help Menu
break;
case 3 :
Credits(); // Shows the Credits available in the file Credits.h
break;
case 4 :
Exit(); // Exits the program
break;
default :
cin.clear();
cin.ignore(100000, '\n');
SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, 14);
cout << "Please choose an option (1 - 4)." << endl;
cout << "\n";
SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, 11);
}
}
```

**Option 1: Start Program**
The option **_< Start Program >_** displays the **Sub Menu** which is discussed in more details further
down.

**Option 2: Help**
The option **_< Help >_** displays the help menu which contains all information on how to navigate the
program and how to interprete some information on the games. This is controlled by the function
**_Help( )_** which is found in the **Help.h** header file.

**Option 3: Credits**
The option **_< Credits >_** displays the Credits which contains some additional information about the
application. These information is displayed using the function **_Credits( )_** which is found in the
**Credits.h** header file.

**Option 4: Exit**
The option **_< Exit >_** closes the application. This is executed by the function **_Exit( )_** which is found
in the **Exit.h** header file. The function **_Exit( )_** is shown below:

void Exit()
{
cout << "\n";
cout << "Exiting...." << endl;
exit(0);
}

**Sub Menu**
The sub menu is controlled by the function **_SubMenu( )_** which is found in the **SubMenu.h** header
file. The sub menu contains two options; Option 1: **Search By Category** & Option 2: **Search By
Name**. The option 1 displays the main categories menu and option 2 displays the text “Enter a Game
Name: ” for the user to enter a game name to be searched.

**Choices**
All the different options in the sub menu are controlled by the **_SubChoice(int choice)_** function
found in the **SubChoice.h** header file. This function takes one parameter. The variable **choice** stores
the choice the user has made and executes the correct function through a switch statement.

**File Cleanup**
All the text files used in this program are first created in Microsoft Excel as a (.xlsx) file. They are
then generated by exporting each sheet in the excel file as a Text(Tab delimited)(*.txt) file. This
means that all the information in the different columns in the excel file will be delimited by a **tab
character (’\t’)** and each row will be delimited by a **return character (’\n’)** in the text file.

However this may cause additional unecessary tab characters (’\t’) to be generated in the text files.
The function **_FileCleanup(string fileName)_** found in the **FileCleanup.h** header file solves this
problem by locating and removing any unecessary tabs in the text files. This function takes as input
one parameter. The variable **fileName** stores the name of the file to “clean up”. This function is
applied to the files **“Category.txt”** and **“SubCategory.txt”**. By removing unecessary tabs in these
files, this ensures consistent formatting of the output displayed to the console.


**Main Categories Menu**
This menu displays the main categories of games on the screen. This gives the user the option to
choose one main category to proceed to the subcategories menu which is explained on the next
page. The main categories menu is displayed using the function **_MainCategories( )_** which is found
in the **Category.h** header file. This function loops through the text file **“Category.txt”** which
contains all the main categories and automatically formats the text depending on the placement of
the tab character in the text file. The function **_MainCategories( )_** has been designed to accept any
number of main categories and it will always fomat them the correct way to the console. This is
further explained in the user manual.

In this menu, the function ask the user to choose a main category and input it to the console in order
to display the corresponding subcategories or the user can type < 0 > to go back to the main menu.

**Subcategories Menu**
This menu displays the subcategories of games on the screen. This gives the user the option to
choose one subcategory to proceed to list the appropriate games to the console. The subcategories
menu is displayed using the function **_SubCategories(int choice)_** which is found in the
**SubCategory.h** header file. This function takes as input one parameter. The variable **choice** stores
the value associated to the list of games to be displayed. The function loops through the text file
**“SubCategory.txt”** which contains all the subcategories and automatically formats the text
depending on the placement of the tab character in the text file. The function **_SubCategories(int
choice)_** has been designed to accept any number of subcategories and it will always fomat them the
correct way to the console. This is further explained in the user manual.

**List Games**
The games listed once the user has chosen a subcategory in the subcategory menu, is controlled by
the function **_ListGames(string fileName)_** found in the **ListGames.h** header file. This function takes
as input one parameter. The variable **fileName** stores the name of the file to output to the console.
This function loops through the appropriate text file **_,_** and automatically formats the text depending
on the placement of the tab character in the text file. The function **_ListGames(string fileName)_** has
been designed to accept any number of game information and it will always fomat them the correct
way to the console. This is further explained in the user manual.

Once the text has been displayed, the user is asked if he/she wants to export the list displayed in a
text file. If the user chooses “Yes”, then the user is asked to specify a path and a name for the file to
be exported.

**Search Games**
The function **_SearchGame(string gameName)_** which is found in the **Search.h** header file controls
Option 2, **Search By Name** , in the sub menu. This function takes as input one parameter. The
variable **gameName** stores the name of the game the user entered to be searched. This function will
loop through all subcategory files and returns a string consisting of each file name in which the
game was found. This string will be used in the function SubChoice to export the list of games in
each file in a single text file. If the game is found the function will call the function
**_ListGames(string fileName)_** to output the list of games in each file to the console. Otherwise if the
game is not found an error message is output to the screen.


**Export**
The list of games generated can be exported as a text file. This is controlled by the function
**_Export(string path, string fileToExport, string fileName)_**. This function takes as input three
parameters. The variable **path** stores the path where to export the file, variable **fileToExport** stores
the name of the file the user has chosen and the variable **fileName** stores the name of the file to be
copied to the file in the variable fileToExport.

The function loops throught the text file stored in the variable **fileName** and copies all the characters
in the exact formatting used to display the list of games to the console to the file named according
to the variable **fileToExport**.

**Menu Options**
The **MenuButton.h** header file contains the function **_MenuButton( )_** which ask the user to either
input < 1 > to return to the main categories menu, input < 2 > to return to the sub menu or input
< 0 > to return to the main menu. The different options are controlled by a switch statement. If an
incorrect input is entered, the **_MenuButton( )_** function is reset and ask the user to input the correct
value again.

## 7.1 Achievements......................................................................................

```
Throughout this assignment, i have been able to develop both technical and non technical skills.
```
```
The technical skills are:
```
- Improved knowledge in C++ in general.
- Improved knowledge in C++ file handling.
- Learning how to design basic user interfaces in console applications.
- Improved knowledge in using git & SourceTree.

```
The non-technical skills are:
```
- Self-learning.
- Managing time.
- Coping with workload process.

```
7.2 Challenges and problems encountered
Since i am a beginner at learning C++, i encountered several issues while coding this program
mostly with the file handling part of C++. This lead me to find some workarounds while still trying
to understand the workings of this great programming language.
```
## 7.3 Future Work........................................................................................

```
While making this program i hardcoded as less portions of it as i could. This lead to a very flexible
application where the database can be easily updated and the program will sill be able to interprete
the data. The potentials of these different functions i created can be extended outside a game
recommendation engine. I have the intention of using these newfound functions to create more
useful and practical softwares.
```

**Update Resources:**

All data in the files used in this application has been retrieved from steam

library(Steam, 2020) and YouTube(YouTube, 2020). The categories, subcategories

and game list can all be updated by following these steps.

**Step 1:**

Open the “Resources.xlsx” file in Microsoft Excel. This file is found in the **\PlayNext**

folder.

**Step 2:**

Add new data to the different sheets in the excel file. New data added must keep the

same format as in the excel file. To add a new category, open the category sheet, add

a new row if the alphabet is not already recorded and then add new main categories

in the columns as shown above. New data has been added on row six in the Category

Sheet.

## Figure 29 : Resources.xlsx

## Figure 30 : Category Sheet


**Step 3:**

The same principles as in step 2 applies to update the subcategories menu. Add a new

row with the new main category title (must also be present in the main category sheet)

and the new subcategories filled in the columns as shown above. New data has been

added on line 10 in the SubCategory Sheet.

**Step 4:**

Apart from the Category and the SubCategory sheets, the rest of the sheets contain the

different list of games for each subcategory. These also can be updated. The list can

both be updated by adding new games in the different rows but also by adding new

columns to add more data about the games as shown above. A new row has been

added on line 11 and a new column has been added on column E.

PlayNext in order to prevent any read/write error from the operating system.
